# PoGoCandyCalc
A small JavaScript application to calculate how many of a pokemon species should be transferred for maximum efficiency during an evolution session (such as on lucky egg when every second is valuable)

By entering the amount of candy you have for a pokemon species type, how many of that pokemon you have on hand, and the amount of candy it takes to evolve one of those pokemon, 
this calculator application can tell you how many of that pokemon you should transfer out for candy in order to get the maximum amount of evolutions.

For example, if you evolve all your Rattata to Raticate that you are able to, you could end up with 20 candy and 6 rattata left.  You could transfer out 5 Rattata, end up with 25 candy and then evolve that last 
Rattata to Raticate.

So the purpose of this calculator is to tell how many you should transfer out to get those last few evolutions.  Perfect to prepare for a 30-minute evolution session on a lucky egg.
